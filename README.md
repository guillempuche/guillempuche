## what I do

Full-stack, end to end. Domain modeling to deployment. I like owning the whole thing.

Clean Architecture, bounded contexts, monorepos with 30-40 packages. Effect.ts for the backend. Errors as values, dependency injection that makes sense, no try-catch soup.

Cross-platform: one codebase, runs on iOS, Android, web. Expo, Tamagui, TanStack Router with SSR.

Unikernels for deployment. After VMs came containers. After containers come unikernels. Single-purpose, millisecond boot, tiny attack surface. I deploy on Unikraft Cloud.

## open source

I use a lot of OSS, so I try to give back. File issues, join Discords, push for things I need.

Lately that's been React 19 and Expo compatibility in [loro](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro-mirror/issues/54), [10tap-editor](https://github.com/10play/10tap-editor/issues/315), [plate](https://github.com/udecode/plate/issues/4457). Also [macOS support for kraft](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/issues/1713).

When I can, I contribute code. [Added locales to Univer](https://github.com/dream-num/univer/pull/5536). Small stuff, but it adds up.

Active in Effect and Unikraft Discord. Lurk in OpenFGA.

## tech

Clean Architecture. DDD when it fits. Local-first when offline matters.
